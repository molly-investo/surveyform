    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Akili na Roho is a programme that was founded in 2010 by a group of psychologists whose main focus was the 
        frequent occurrences of conflicts in society. The present society has become very individualistic yet people 
        cannot handle their problems without help whic is not easily given and hence this organization.
    </p>
    <h2>Community for the people</h2>
    <p>There are only a number of psychologists, hence unproportional to the population but thats where you come
        in. What we are building is a community for the peole which is made of you and me. We train volunteeers
        on how to handle and help the ailing generation since the first step to empowerment is dealing with the ignorance 
        in that field. In short, we need in order to prove helpful to the community.
    </p>
    <h3>Join us</h3>
    <p>Every group or society has a couple of characteristics or attributes that identifies them and so do we.
     Since this is a community project, we encourage feedback on topics and issues you would like us to 
     highlight put them at the forefront of our organization. Your feedback will be highly appreciated.
